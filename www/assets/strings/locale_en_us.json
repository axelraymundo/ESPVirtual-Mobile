You have the right to request restrictions on certain uses and disclosures of your personal data by a written request, specifying the reason, what information you want to limit, and what limitations on our use or disclosure of that information you wish to impose. If you tell us not to disclose your information, we will abide by your request, unless we must disclose the information for legal reasons or as may be required under the terms of our contract. We reserve the right to accept or reject any other request and will notify you of our decision.\n\n2. Right to Inspect and Copy.

If you wish to send a copy to any other person, there must be a written authorization, which must be duly notarized. We may deny your request under limited circumstances.

Right to a Paper or Electronic Copy of this Notice. You have a right to be notified of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your personal data, including a right to a paper copy of this Privacy Notice, even if you have previously requested its receipt by e-mail.\n\nIf you would like to have further information regarding your rights as data subject or how these rights may be exercised, you may refer to the DOE Privacy Policy available in the website or you may contact our Data Protection Officer listed in Section 3 of this Privacy Notice.\n\n3 The Personal Data we Collect\n\nDOE collects personal data about you such as name, contact number, email address and other necessary details to serve your requirement and stores it in a computer system application and/or filing folders.
